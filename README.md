ShareKit 2.0
============

In order to make it easier for new users to choose a canonical fork of ShareKit, the ShareKit community has decided to band together and take responsibility for collecting useful commits into what we're calling "ShareKit 2.0". In the next week or two, we'll be working to test and release the first officially stable version of ShareKit since February, with more frequent updates expected thereafter.

You can follow the initial planning at https://github.com/ideashower/ShareKit/issues/283.
