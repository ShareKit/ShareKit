/*

 For a step by step guide to creating your service class, start at the top and move down through the comments.
 
 It is strongly recommended you read 'Understanding the share flow' documentation for a brief overview
 of how a service works: http://getsharekit.com/docs/#flow
 
 If your service requires any apikeys, open DefaultSHKConfigurator.m and add methods for them so user can easily
 fill them out. Open the file to see examples of other services using api keys.
