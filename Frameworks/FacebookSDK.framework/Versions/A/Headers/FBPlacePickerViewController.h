 @class FBPlacePickerViewController

 @abstract
 The `FBPlacePickerViewController` class creates a controller object that manages
 the user interface for displaying and selecting nearby places.

 @discussion
 When the `FBPlacePickerViewController` view loads it creates a `UITableView` object
 where the places near a given location will be displayed. You can access this view
 through the `tableView` property.

 The place data can be pre-fetched and cached prior to using the view controller. The
 cache is setup using an <FBCacheDescriptor> object that can trigger the
 data fetch. Any place data requests will first check the cache and use that data.
 If the place picker is being displayed cached data will initially be shown before
 a fresh copy is retrieved.

 The `delegate` property may be set to an object that conforms to the <FBPlacePickerDelegate>
 protocol. The `delegate` object will receive updates related to place selection and
 data changes. The delegate can also be used to filter the places to display in the
 picker.
