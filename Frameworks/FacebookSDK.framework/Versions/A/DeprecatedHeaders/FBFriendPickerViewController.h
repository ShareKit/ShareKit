 @class

 @abstract
 The `FBFriendPickerViewController` class creates a controller object that manages
 the user interface for displaying and selecting Facebook friends.

 @discussion
 When the `FBFriendPickerViewController` view loads it creates a `UITableView` object
 where the friends will be displayed. You can access this view through the `tableView`
 property. The friend display can be sorted by first name or last name. Friends'
 names can be displayed with the first name first or the last name first.

 The friend data can be pre-fetched and cached prior to using the view controller. The
 cache is setup using an <FBCacheDescriptor> object that can trigger the
 data fetch. Any friend data requests will first check the cache and use that data.
 If the friend picker is being displayed cached data will initially be shown before
 a fresh copy is retrieved.

 The `delegate` property may be set to an object that conforms to the <FBFriendPickerDelegate>
 protocol. The `delegate` object will receive updates related to friend selection and
 data changes. The delegate can also be used to filter the friends to display in the
 picker.
