 @typedef SHKShareType
 @abstract This is a hint for ShareKit about what type of data do you want to share.
 @constant SHKShareTypeUserInfo There are two ways services interact with ShareKit - some store credentials in user's keychain, some do not. If they do not, you have to fetch available user info using this share type. The user info is then fetched and stored in kSHK<sharerName>UserInfo> key in NSUserDefaults. You might want to wait for SHKSendDidFinishNotification and then update your UI. User info is fetched automatically after successful login. If you only need username, you can call username method on sharer's class.
