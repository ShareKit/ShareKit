/*	optionPickerInfo contains the info needed to present the fact that there is a value that 
 can be picked from a list. The actual choices can be provided in the optionPickerInfo or
 the sharer can provide them when asked. The latter is for when the option is something that
 can't be known ahead of time, like the list of albums to place a photo in or a group that a
 user belongs to.
 
 The format of the data is:
 'title' => title to put at the top of the list
 'curIndexes' => NSString comma sep list of index into the items list or -1.
 'allowMultiple' => NSNumber boolVal if true then multiple options can be picked and a done button is added.
 the value is to a comma delimited string, see SHKFormOptionController:pickedOption:
 'itemsList' => NSArray of NSString
 'static' => NSNumber boolVal false if the choices must be loaded with a network operation
 if static is false then you must also include
 'SHKFormOptionControllerOptionProvider' => something that implements the SHKFormOptionControllerOptionProvider
 protocol.
