 @discussion SHKFormFieldOptionPickerSettings contains the info needed to present the value that
 can be picked from a list. The actual choices can be provided here or
 the sharer can provide them when asked. The latter is for when the option is something that
 can't be known ahead of time, like the list of albums to place a photo in or a group that a
 user belongs to.
