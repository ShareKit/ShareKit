/** Called just before shareItem is called with this item on sharer. This gives you 
 a last minute chance to customize the data in the item before the share takes place.
 For example when posting a photo to a web service, there isn't any point in generating
 compressing and sending over the wire a 4000X4000 image if the max size for the service
 is 600X600.
 @param item - item that is being shared
 @param sharer - the sharer that will share the item
 @returns YES if the item should be shared by ShareKit, NO is the callee is going
 to handle it. This is useful if generating the image at the appropriate size for
 the service is an async process.*/
